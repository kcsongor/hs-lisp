# hs-lisp
A simple functional language with a lisp-like syntax written in Haskell
(heavily inspired by Haskell)

##### What works:
- type inference
- lambda calculus
- user-defined data types (only with type variables for now)

##### TODO:
- type literals
- pattern matching
- parser errors (ExeptT transformer)
- macro system
- dependent types
- syntax subject to change
